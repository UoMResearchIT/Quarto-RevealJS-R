# Quarto + Reveal.js

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

The repo is `R` - specific only in that it installs `R`, `rmarkdown` and `knitr` as part of the automated build action: `.github/workflows/render-quarto.yml`.
