# Quarto + Reveal.js

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

Slides should be rendered automatically to `gh-pages`, in this case: <https://uomresearchit.github.io/Quarto-RevealJS-R/>

The repo is `R` - specific only in that it installs `R`, `rmarkdown` and `knitr` as part of the [render-quarto.yml](.github/workflows/render-quarto.yml) build action.
