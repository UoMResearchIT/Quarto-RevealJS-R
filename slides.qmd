## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Fancier Code Blocks

```{r, filename='fake_script.R'}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: true

# Multiply two numbers
multiply <- function(a, b) {
  return(a * b)
}
multiply(a = 6, b = 7)
```
